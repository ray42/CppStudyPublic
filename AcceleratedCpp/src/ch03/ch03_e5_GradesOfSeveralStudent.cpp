// 3-5: Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students
// at once. The program could keep two vectors in sync:
// 1) The first should hold the student's names,
// 2) and the second the final grades that can be computed as input is read.
//
// For now, you should assume a fixed number of homework grades.
//

// Answer: just put a loop around the program in the chapter. I cba doing 
// this.
