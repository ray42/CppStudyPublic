These are worked examples by Raymon White


1) The binary files (executables) are in bin/
   This directory is kept empty by the bash script introduced below.


2) The src files for each chapter are in src/

3) The run.bash script is in src/. Run it from src/
   Usage: ./run.bash chapter00
            compiles the program, 
            runs the program, 
            deletes the object files and executables
   
   Comment out make clean-all to keep the binary files
